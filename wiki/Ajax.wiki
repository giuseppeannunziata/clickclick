!ClickClick provides out-of-the-box server side Ajax support through [http://code.google.com/p/clickclick/source/browse/trunk/clickclick/core/src/net/sf/clickclick/ClickClickServlet.java ClickClickServlet].

=== Activate Ajax Support ===

In order to make use of Ajax support you must use the !ClickClickServlet. See GettingStarted on how to setup the !ClickClickServlet.

=== The Ajax request cycle ===

Before digging into the Ajax request cycle, lets first look at Click's normal request cycle:

Here is the list of events processed during normal request execution:

 # onSecurityCheck()
 # onInit()
 # onProcess
 # onGet() / onPost()
 # onRender()
 # onDestroy()

Ajax requests are handled a bit differently. Here is the Ajax GET request execution sequence:

The following events are processed during an Ajax request:

 # onSecurityCheck()
 # onInit()
 # onProcess()
